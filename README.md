# DetectionCarLogos
Detection car logos via matlab.
Programs detects car logos which i selected. I used image processing equations to seperate car logos from each other.
You can add more logos to detection but you need to select similar logos. Program can not detect all kind of logos because i didn't train a neural network and didn't use datasets.
Please write any of your questions to mehmetmutlu2914@gmail.com
